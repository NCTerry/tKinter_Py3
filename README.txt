# tKinter_Py3

Standard tKinter pages for all Py3+ work
This repository is for the basic use of any tKinter functions and pages based on Python3+

I have separated files based on specific functions. 

Nearly everything can be combined, but are separated for ease of accessibility. 

We are progressing in order, as seen by the initial number on the file name.
	File 4 is next in line from file 3 and is likely playing directly from it.
	Files with the same number are used by the py file.
		EX.  4icon.png is an image being used by the 4â€¦.py file.
